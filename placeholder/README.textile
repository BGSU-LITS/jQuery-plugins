h1. jQuery placeholder plugin

This plugin is simple, all you need to do is include this script and add placeholder
attributes to the form input and textarea elements as you would normally. If the 
user's browser doesn't have native support for the placeholder attribute this script
adds it in.

By default the class that is added to the input is _placeholder_ so just add a 
.placeholder to your stylesheet and away you go. Below is a simple one-liner.

<code>.placeholder{ color:#BBB; }</code>
